The pt recalls waking and getting ready for work.  He then began having short episodes of vertiginous attacks in which he felt the room was \"constantly going out of focus\" and inability to \"lock in on any one thing\".  The pt had several episodes of these presyncopal attacks w/o LOC.  The pt had no associated CP or palpitations, however noted some increased rate of breathing.  The pt also noted some reflux sx a/w attacks.  He denies f/c, ns, d/c, diploplia/photophobia.  Had associated nausea without vomiting as well as tinnitus, which he usually has.  Attacks began to affect driving so he presented to EW.\n\n\n\nPt has one prior episode similar to this experience in 2082, for which he received imaging studies including CT of the head, MRI/MRA, TCDs which revealed no infarcts, but poor flow in the mid-basilar artery.  TTE at that time showed an intra-atrial septal aneurysm.  \n\n\n\nROS: +tinnitus, -weakness/change in sensation, ataxia, aura-like sx, post-episode confusion\n\n\t+ anorexia, nausea\n\n \n\nPMH: \n\nCAD: 2075 PTCA w/ Angioplasty to LAD, Stress (3/88): rev. anterolateral ischemia, Cath (5/88): 3v disease: RCA 90%, LAD 30% mid, 80% distal, D1 70%, D2 40% and 60%, LCx 30%, OM2 80% \n\nHTN\n\nHypercholesterolemia\n\nGERD\n\nH/O cerebral embolism (2082)\n\nH/O intra-arterial septal aneurysm\n\n\n\nMeds: \n\nAtenolol 25/50mg qAM/qPM\n\nASA 325mg qD\n\nPrilosec 20mg qD\n\nLipitor 10mg qD\n\nNTG sl prn: last used several months ago as a \"test\"\n\n\n\nALL: NKDA, Intolerance to Inderal\n\n\n\nFHx: \n\n+ HTN: mother /brother\n\n+DM: mother\n\n+MI: father\n\n\n\nSoc Hx: Lives by himself separated.

He has not taken nitroglycerine for 6 months. He exercises for 25 minutes 3 days per week on the treadmill and does not get chest pain. He does continue to gain weight because of dietary caloric indiscretion. He is not having any edema or orthopnea. \n\n\n\nFamily history:\n\n   Brother has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. \n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-General:   No acute distress.\n\n-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.\n\n-Heent:   Unremarkable\n\n-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits.

I discussed with him the reason for his persistent positive stress test and the posterolateral redistribution being related to the circumflex occlusion. There is good collaterals to this territory and I told Ted he needs to continue to exercise to build up those collaterals. We will repeat a stress test on him next spring to make sure he has not had progression of disease in his other arteries. \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:   Ulysses B.

He has not taken nitroglycerine for 6 months. He exercises for 25 minutes 3 days per week on the treadmill and does not get chest pain. He does continue to gain weight because of dietary caloric indiscretion. He is not having any edema or orthopnea. \n\n\n\nFamily history:\n\n   Brother has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. \n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-General:   No acute distress.\n\n-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.\n\n-Heent:   Unremarkable\n\n-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits.

Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 +S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.\n\n-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. 2+ pedal pulses.\n\n-Neuro:   A&O x3, CN 2-12 grossly intact. \n\n-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and has mild epigastric tenderness, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.\n\n-BP: 127/55  \n\n-Pulse: 43  \n\n-weight: 185  lbs.\n\n-BMI:   \n\n\n\nEKG:\n\n   Sinus rhythm, intraventricular conduction defect, poor RWave progression, unchanged from previous.\n\n\n\n\n\nImpression:\n\n   Ted continues to do well. I discussed with him the reason for his persistent positive stress test and the posterolateral redistribution being related to the circumflex occlusion. There is good collaterals to this territory and I told Ted he needs to continue to exercise to build up those collaterals. We will repeat a stress test on him next spring to make sure he has not had progression of disease in his other arteries. \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:   Ulysses B.

His blood pressure is 127/55 mmHg, pulse is 43 beats per minute, and weight is 185 pounds. He has a BMI of 26.6, indicating overweight status. His physical examination reveals no rashes, anicteric skin, unremarkable HEENT, carotids 2+, and no jugular venous distention. His cardiac examination shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and no S3 or S4. His extremities show no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, and 2+ femoral pulses without bruits.\n\n**Assessment and Plan**\n\nThe patient's CAD and HTN are being managed with medications. His recent lab results indicate elevated triglycerides, which may be related to diabetes mellitus (DM). His HbA1c level is elevated, suggesting poorly controlled DM. The patient should have his HbA1c level checked regularly and covered with insulin as needed. A nutrition consultation for diet education is recommended. Consideration should be given to adding glipizide to manage his DM.\n\nThe patient's anxiety is well-controlled with Valium. His asthma is being managed with Advair. His BPH symptoms are being monitored.\n\nThe patient's cardiovascular system is stable, and he should continue his current medication regimen. His lipid profile should be monitored regularly, and consideration should be given to adding niacin to manage his elevated triglycerides.\n\nOverall, the patient requires ongoing management of his CAD, HTN, DM, and other comorbid conditions to prevent complications and improve his quality of life."

The pt recalls waking and getting ready for work.  He then began having short episodes of vertiginous attacks in which he felt the room was \"constantly going out of focus\" and inability to \"lock in on any one thing\".  The pt had several episodes of these presyncopal attacks w/o LOC.  The pt had no associated CP or palpitations, however noted some increased rate of breathing.  The pt also noted some reflux sx a/w attacks.  He denies f/c, ns, d/c, diploplia/photophobia.  Had associated nausea without vomiting as well as tinnitus, which he usually has.  Attacks began to affect driving so he presented to EW.\n\n\n\nPt has one prior episode similar to this experience in 2082, for which he received imaging studies including CT of the head, MRI/MRA, TCDs which revealed no infarcts, but poor flow in the mid-basilar artery.

He has not taken nitroglycerine for 6 months. He exercises for 25 minutes 3 days per week on the treadmill and does not get chest pain. He does continue to gain weight because of dietary caloric indiscretion. He is not having any edema or orthopnea. \n\n\n\nFamily history:\n\n   Brother has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. \n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-General:   No acute distress.\n\n-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.\n\n-Heent:   Unremarkable\n\n-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits.

There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.\n\n-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. 2+ pedal pulses.\n\n-Neuro:   A&O x3, CN 2-12 grossly intact. \n\n-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and has mild epigastric tenderness, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.\n\n-BP: 127/55  \n\n-Pulse: 43  \n\n-weight: 185  lbs.\n\n-BMI:   \n\n\n\nEKG:\n\n   Sinus rhythm, intraventricular conduction defect, poor RWave progression, unchanged from previous.\n\n\n\n\n\nImpression:\n\n   Ted continues to do well. I discussed with him the reason for his persistent positive stress test and the posterolateral redistribution being related to the circumflex occlusion. There is good collaterals to this territory and I told Ted he needs to continue to exercise to build up those collaterals. We will repeat a stress test on him next spring to make sure he has not had progression of disease in his other arteries. \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:   Ulysses B.

The pt recalls waking and getting ready for work.  He then began having short episodes of vertiginous attacks in which he felt the room was \"constantly going out of focus\" and inability to \"lock in on any one thing\".  The pt had several episodes of these presyncopal attacks w/o LOC.  The pt had no associated CP or palpitations, however noted some increased rate of breathing.  The pt also noted some reflux sx a/w attacks.  He denies f/c, ns, d/c, diploplia/photophobia.  Had associated nausea without vomiting as well as tinnitus, which he usually has.  Attacks began to affect driving so he presented to EW.\n\n\n\nPt has one prior episode similar to this experience in 2082, for which he received imaging studies including CT of the head, MRI/MRA, TCDs which revealed no infarcts, but poor flow in the mid-basilar artery.

He has not taken nitroglycerine for 6 months. He exercises for 25 minutes 3 days per week on the treadmill and does not get chest pain. He does continue to gain weight because of dietary caloric indiscretion. He is not having any edema or orthopnea. \n\n\n\nFamily history:\n\n   Brother has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. \n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-General:   No acute distress.\n\n-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.\n\n-Heent:   Unremarkable\n\n-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.\n\n-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.\n\n-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 +S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.\n\n-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. 2+ pedal pulses.\n\n-Neuro:   A&O x3, CN 2-12 grossly intact. \n\n-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and has mild epigastric tenderness, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.\n\n-BP: 127/55  \n\n-Pulse: 43  \n\n-weight: 185  lbs.\n\n-BMI:   \n\n\n\nEKG:\n\n   Sinus rhythm, intraventricular conduction defect, poor RWave progression, unchanged from previous.\n\n\n\n\n\nImpression:\n\n   Ted continues to do well. I discussed with him the reason for his persistent positive stress test and the posterolateral redistribution being related to the circumflex occlusion. There is good collaterals to this territory and I told Ted he needs to continue to exercise to build up those collaterals. We will repeat a stress test on him next spring to make sure he has not had progression of disease in his other arteries. \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:   Ulysses B.
