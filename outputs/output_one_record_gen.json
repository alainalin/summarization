The pt recalls waking and getting ready for work.  He then began having short episodes of vertiginous attacks in which he felt the room was \"constantly going out of focus\" and inability to \"lock in on any one thing\".  The pt had several episodes of these presyncopal attacks w/o LOC.  The pt had no associated CP or palpitations, however noted some increased rate of breathing.  The pt also noted some reflux sx a/w attacks.  He denies f/c, ns, d/c, diploplia/photophobia.  Had associated nausea without vomiting as well as tinnitus, which he usually has.  Attacks began to affect driving so he presented to EW.\n\n\n\nPt has one prior episode similar to this experience in 2082, for which he received imaging studies including CT of the head, MRI/MRA, TCDs which revealed no infarcts, but poor flow in the mid-basilar artery.  TTE at that time showed an intra-atrial septal aneurysm.  \n\n\n\nROS: +tinnitus, -weakness/change in sensation, ataxia, aura-like sx, post-episode confusion\n\n\t+ anorexia, nausea\n\n \n\nPMH: \n\nCAD: 2075 PTCA w/ Angioplasty to LAD, Stress (3/88): rev. anterolateral ischemia, Cath (5/88): 3v disease: RCA 90%, LAD 30% mid, 80% distal, D1 70%, D2 40% and 60%, LCx 30%, OM2 80% \n\nHTN\n\nHypercholesterolemia\n\nGERD\n\nH/O cerebral embolism (2082)\n\nH/O intra-arterial septal aneurysm\n\n\n\nMeds: \n\nAtenolol 25/50mg qAM/qPM\n\nASA 325mg qD\n\nPrilosec 20mg qD\n\nLipitor 10mg qD\n\nNTG sl prn: last used several months ago as a \"test\"\n\n\n\nALL: NKDA, Intolerance to Inderal\n\n\n\nFHx: \n\n+ HTN: mother /brother\n\n+DM: mother\n\n+MI: father\n\n\n\nSoc Hx: Lives by himself separated.

He presents with a 6-hour history of vertiginous symptoms, including lightheadedness, dizziness, and feeling \"like he was going to pass out.\" The patient reports several episodes of these presyncopal attacks without loss of consciousness, and notes some associated nausea, tinnitus, and reflux symptoms.\n\nThe patient's physical examination reveals a normal neurological examination, except for lateral beating nystagmus. His cardiovascular examination shows a regular rhythm with a slight increase in heart rate. His blood pressure is elevated at 147/90 mmHg.\n\nLaboratory results show an elevated glucose level at 157 mg/dl, and an elevated total cholesterol level at 312 mg/dl. The patient's lipid profile shows an elevated triglyceride level at 307 mg/dl, and a low HDL level at 9 mg/dl.\n\nThe patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a sinus bradycardia with left axis deviation and nonspecific ST/T wave changes. His chest X-ray (CXR) is pending.\n\nThe impression is that the patient may have vertebral basilar insufficiency (VBI) versus peripheral vertigo, given his clinical presentation and history. The plan includes ruling out progression of atherosclerotic or new embolic disease in the posterior circulation, and consulting neurology to evaluate the patient further.\n\nThe patient will undergo non-invasive studies, including magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCDs), and other tests to assess circulation. Aspirin therapy will be continued at 325 mg daily.\n\nThe patient's CAD, HTN, and GERD will be managed with medication adjustments, including restarting an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and continuing beta-blockade and statin therapy. The patient will also receive general care, including proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and a full diet with cardiac precautions.assistant\n\nThis summary accurately captures the key points from the medical history and plan for the patient. It highlights the patient's complex medical history, including CAD, HTN, GERD, and past cerebral embolism, and presents the current symptoms of vertigo and potential VBI or"

The pt recalls waking and getting ready for work.  He then began having short episodes of vertiginous attacks in which he felt the room was \"constantly going out of focus\" and inability to \"lock in on any one thing\".  The pt had several episodes of these presyncopal attacks w/o LOC.  The pt had no associated CP or palpitations, however noted some increased rate of breathing.  The pt also noted some reflux sx a/w attacks.  He denies f/c, ns, d/c, diploplia/photophobia.  Had associated nausea without vomiting as well as tinnitus, which he usually has.  Attacks began to affect driving so he presented to EW.\n\n\n\nPt has one prior episode similar to this experience in 2082, for which he received imaging studies including CT of the head, MRI/MRA, TCDs which revealed no infarcts, but poor flow in the mid-basilar artery.  TTE at that time showed an intra-atrial septal aneurysm.  \n\n\n\nROS: +tinnitus, -weakness/change in sensation, ataxia, aura-like sx, post-episode confusion\n\n\t+ anorexia, nausea\n\n \n\nPMH: \n\nCAD: 2075 PTCA w/ Angioplasty to LAD, Stress (3/88): rev. anterolateral ischemia, Cath (5/88): 3v disease: RCA 90%, LAD 30% mid, 80% distal, D1 70%, D2 40% and 60%, LCx 30%, OM2 80% \n\nHTN\n\nHypercholesterolemia\n\nGERD\n\nH/O cerebral embolism (2082)\n\nH/O intra-arterial septal aneurysm\n\n\n\nMeds: \n\nAtenolol 25/50mg qAM/qPM\n\nASA 325mg qD\n\nPrilosec 20mg qD\n\nLipitor 10mg qD\n\nNTG sl prn: last used several months ago as a \"test\"\n\n\n\nALL: NKDA, Intolerance to Inderal\n\n\n\nFHx: \n\n+ HTN: mother /brother\n\n+DM: mother\n\n+MI: father\n\n\n\nSoc Hx: Lives by himself separated.

            "content": "The patient is a 64-year-old male with a significant medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and a past history of cerebral embolism. He presents with a 6-hour history of vertiginous symptoms, including lightheadedness, dizziness, and feeling \"like he was going to pass out.\" The patient reports several episodes of these presyncopal attacks without loss of consciousness, and notes some increased rate of breathing, nausea, and tinnitus.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a previous episode similar to this experience in 2082, for which he underwent imaging studies revealing no infarcts but poor flow in the mid-basilar artery. He also has an intra-atrial septal aneurysm.\n\nThe patient's current medications include atenolol, aspirin, Prilosec, Lipitor, and nitroglycerin (last used several months ago). His family history is notable for HTN and diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe physical examination reveals a well-nourished male with a normal mental status, clear lungs, and a regular heart rhythm. The cardiovascular examination shows a systolic murmur, and the neurological examination reveals lateral beating nystagmus.\n\nLaboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial injury. Other laboratory values are within normal limits.\n\nThe electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus bradycardia with left axis deviation and nonspecific ST/T wave changes. The chest X-ray (CXR) is pending.\n\nThe impression is that the patient may have vertebral basilar insufficiency (VBI) versus peripheral vertigo. The plan is to rule out progression of atherosclerotic or new embolic disease in the posterior circulation, given the patient's clinical exam and history.\n\nThe patient will undergo further evaluation, including magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCDs), and other non-invasive studies of circulation. Aspirin therapy will be continued, and beta-blockade and statin therapy will be restarted. Hypertension will be controlled with medication. The patient will also receive general care, including Nexium, full diet, and cardiac prudent measures.assistant\n\nHere is a summary of the medical history related to CAD:\n\n* Patient has a significant history of CAD, with a previous episode of coronary artery disease in"

            "content": "The patient is a 64-year-old man with a significant medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and a past history of cerebral embolism. He presents with a 6-hour history of vertiginous symptoms, including lightheadedness, dizziness, and feeling \"like he was going to pass out.\" The patient reports several episodes of these presyncopal attacks without loss of consciousness, and notes some associated nausea, tinnitus, and reflux symptoms.\n\nThe patient's physical examination reveals a normal neurological examination, except for lateral beating nystagmus and good rapid alternating movements. His cardiovascular examination shows a regular rhythm with a slight increase in heart rate.\n\nLaboratory results show elevated glucose levels, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and a mild anemia. Other laboratory values are within normal limits.\n\nThe patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus bradycardia with left axis deviation and nonspecific ST/T wave changes.\n\nThe impression is that the patient's symptoms are consistent with vestibular balance disorder (VBI) versus peripheral vertigo. The plan includes ruling out progression of atherosclerotic or new embolic disease in the posterior circulation, given the patient's clinical exam and history.\n\nThe patient will undergo further evaluation, including magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCDs), and other non-invasive studies of circulation. He will also receive aspirin 325mg daily and continue his current medications, including beta blockers and statins.\n\nThe patient's CAD, HTN, and GERD will be managed accordingly, with adjustments made as necessary. The patient will also receive general care, including Nexium, full diet, and cardiac prudent measures.\n\nOverall, the patient requires careful management of his multiple comorbidities and ongoing evaluation to rule out potential complications.assistant\n\nHere is a summary of the patient's medical history and current situation:\n\n**Medical History:**\n\n* Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)\n* Hypertension (HTN)\n* Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)\n* Past history of cerebral embolism\n* Intra-arterial septal aneurysm\n* Family history of hypertension and myocardial infarction\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n* Presents with 6-hour history of vertiginous symptoms, including lightheadedness,"

The pt recalls waking and getting ready for work.  He then began having short episodes of vertiginous attacks in which he felt the room was \"constantly going out of focus\" and inability to \"lock in on any one thing\".  The pt had several episodes of these presyncopal attacks w/o LOC.  The pt had no associated CP or palpitations, however noted some increased rate of breathing.  The pt also noted some reflux sx a/w attacks.  He denies f/c, ns, d/c, diploplia/photophobia.  Had associated nausea without vomiting as well as tinnitus, which he usually has.  Attacks began to affect driving so he presented to EW.\n\n\n\nPt has one prior episode similar to this experience in 2082, for which he received imaging studies including CT of the head, MRI/MRA, TCDs which revealed no infarcts, but poor flow in the mid-basilar artery.

            "content": "The patient is a 64-year-old man with a significant medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and a past history of cerebral embolism. He presents with a 6-hour history of vertiginous symptoms, including lightheadedness, dizziness, and feeling \"like he was going to pass out.\" The patient reports waking up and getting ready for work when the symptoms started, and they have been recurring throughout the day.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a previous episode of similar symptoms in 2082, for which he underwent imaging studies, including CT of the head, MRI/MRA, and TCDs, which revealed no infarcts but poor flow in the mid-basilar artery. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) at that time showed an intra-atrial septal aneurysm.\n\nThe patient's current medications include atenolol, aspirin, Prilosec, Lipitor, and nitroglycerin sublingually as needed. His family history is significant for HTN and myocardial infarction in his parents.\n\nOn physical examination, the patient is well-nourished and alert, with a blood pressure of 147/90 mmHg. His heart rate is regular, and his lungs are clear to auscultation. His neurological examination reveals lateral beating nystagmus, but his motor strength is grossly intact.\n\nLaboratory results show elevated glucose levels (157 mg/dl), elevated total protein (8.4 g/dl), and globulin (4.2 g/dl). His lipid profile shows elevated triglycerides (307 mg/dl) and LDL cholesterol (123 mg/dl).\n\nThe patient undergoes an electrocardiogram (ECG) showing sinus bradycardia with left axis deviation and nonspecific ST/T wave changes. Chest X-ray is pending.\n\nThe impression is that the patient may have vertebral basilar insufficiency (VBI) versus peripheral vertigo, given his clinical presentation and history. The plan is to rule out progression of atherosclerotic or new embolic disease in the posterior circulation, and to consult neurology for further evaluation.\n\nThe patient will continue aspirin, beta-blockade, and statin therapy, and restart an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as per cardiology.
